Week 1: On the first week of the project, our team was formed and we started brainstorming project ideas. We figured to use a large enough dataset to create elaborate outputs from our algorithm. With that, we came up with using the 50 most populous US cities as our data nodes, and we decided to use Djikstra's and Floyd-Warshal's as our algorithms. We composed an approved contract and proposal.

Week 2: Originally, we had tried to incorporate the A* search algorithm to find the shortest paths, but we were suggested to switch to the other two algorithms listed above. With that, we changed our proposal to suit those needs, and we started working on how to implement those algorithms along with our datasets.

Week 3: Not much work occurred this week, we just continued brainstorming and composing pseudocode for our implementation.

Week 4: This week, we learned more about our algorithms, how they are implemented, and we continued our writing of pseudocode in order to get close to a correct implementation. Aside from our algorithms, we learned about the BFS traversal and started pseudocode for that as well.

Week 5: After a successful meeting with our mentor, we finalized our pseudocode and started implementing code in our repo. This started by copying and pasting our pseudocode and writing C++ after that. Despite this, we had some syntax errors as well as runtime errors that kept us busy.

Week 6: In our first full week of repo coding, we made data processing functions to parse our city data to create nodes and edges for our graph. We continued to fine tune and debug our algorithms, minimizing helper function calls and runtime optimization. We also added tests that worked with our implementation. Aside from testing, our outputs created accurate shortest paths between all cities.
