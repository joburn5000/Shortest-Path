Leading Question 

- Given a graph of connected nodes, how can one find the shortest path from start to finish 
using the Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm, dijkstra's algorithm, and BFS traversal. How do these compare and 
what does this teach us about different kinds of efficiency?
- We are hoping to solve the problem of finding the shortest path from one node to another 
node using several types of algorithms / a traversal.


Successful project: 
- We produce a working algorithm that reliably outputs a sequence of from a starting node to an ending node. 
- Optional: Implementing algorithms into a maze shortest path from start to finish.


Dataset
- Our dataset will be from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities
- It is a downloadable file that contains the latitude and longitude for towns in America

- Other: Graphs, Priority Queue
- In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue 
or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. 
In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.


Data Acquisition and Processing
- We will download, store, and process data in the following manner: 
- We will doanload the file from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities as an excel sheet
- We will then process this data by writing an algorithm to convert the cells in the excel sheet
to nodes, using latitude and longitude to get our datapoints so we can calculate distance
- To handle the messiness of real world data, we will solve issues by researching the common ways 
to tackle them. We will brainstorm as a team in order to come up with our best guess of a solution. 
- If our solution does not work, then we will decide as a team what other solutions may work.


Graph Algorithms 
- Dijkstra's algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm is based on the principle of relaxation, in which more accurate
values gradually replace an approximation to the correct distance until the shortest distance is reached.
- Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm: Floyd-Warshall, on the other hand, computes the shortest distances between
every pair of vertices in the input graph. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an example of dynamic programming.
It breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems, then combines the answers to those subproblems to solve
the big, initial problem.


Traversal: 
- BFS: Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching a graph for a node that satisfies 
a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving 
on to the nodes at the next depth level
 

Inputs: A graph of nodes, a start node, and an end node.


Outputs: A graph of the same format consisting of the shortest path from start to end, easing the comparison
between the full graph and the shortest possible path.
